## 🧠 Project Summary

In this capstone project, I explored a simulated airline operations database using advanced SQL techniques to extract business-critical insights.

> From passengers to planes — every SQL query was designed to **optimize operations, improve customer service, and drive revenue** using relational data.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **SQL** (Skillovilla Playground)  
- **Relational Database** with multiple normalized tables  
- **Airline DB Schema** (Bookings, Flights, Aircraft, Tickets, etc.)

---

## 🧑‍💻 Role & Scope

**Role:** Data Analyst  
**Project Type:** Capstone Project  
**Tasks:**  
- 30+ business scenario-based queries  
- Data cleaning, transformation, time-series exploration  
- Multi-table joins, nested queries, aggregations

---

## 🔍 Analytical Highlights

### 🧼 Data Cleaning & Date Formatting
- Converted `book_date` to `yyyy-mmm-dd` for reporting clarity  
- Handled `NULL` values and anomalies with `COALESCE()` and filters  

### 💰 Customer & Revenue Insights
- Identified **top & bottom revenue passengers** by month  
- Flagged **return travelers** via multi-flight ticket detection  
- Analyzed **revenue sources** by fare class and time frame  

### ✈️ Aircraft & Route Optimization
- Highlighted **least-used seat numbers** for better aircraft utilization  
- Identified **delays & cancellations** by aircraft model (Airbus vs Boeing)  
- Ranked **longest flights** based on duration for route planning  

### 📆 Flight Scheduling & Demand Windows
- Extracted **early AM (2–6 AM)** and **morning (6–11 AM)** flights  
- Mapped **airport-wise flight distribution** (KZN, DME, etc.)  
- Found **busiest & slowest airports** based on scheduled departures  

### 💺 Seat Capacity & Business Class Insights
- Aggregated **seat availability** by `fare_condition` across aircraft  
- Tracked **business-class-ready aircrafts** for premium expansion  

### 🌍 Regional Mapping & Route Trends
- Filtered routes in the **Europe/Moscow timezone**  
- Mapped **flights per departure region**, revealing demand hubs  

### 📉 Risk & Refund Management
- Listed **customers eligible for refunds** with calculated amounts  
- Linked **cancellations by aircraft make** for risk trend analysis  

### 🚀 Range & Operational Capability
- Isolated **mid-range (3000–6000 km)** flights for clustering  
- Highlighted **highest range aircraft** supporting long-hauls  

### 🛬 Airport Ops & Crew Scheduling
- Found **most cancelled arrivals per airport**  
- Extracted **first & last flights daily per location**
